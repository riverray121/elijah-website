        <h1>FULL ROOM LOFT</h1>
        <p><br>In New York City, housing is extremely small and very expensive. To combat this, I built a loft that covers my entire floor space in my bedroom, doubling my usable space for no added rent.</p>

        <h2>Finished Product</h2>
        <p>9x8ft room transformed into a lofted platform with a queen bed and storage up top and a desk, futon, and storage down below. <br>Fiber optic star ceiling is unnecessary but awesome.</p>

        <h2>Bare Bones Stucture</h2>
        <p>I built the loft entirely within my 9x8ft room. This included all cuts, assembly, and design adjustments.<br>One issue I did not anticipate was the way my cheap circular saw and the poor quality of New York lumber <br>would result in an enormous amount of smoke as I cooked each 2x4 I cut far past well done.</p>

        <h2>CAD Initial Mock-Up</h2>
        <p>After getting the dimensions of the room I played around with various layouts and designs until I was happy.</p>
